<p> My new <del>keyboarf</del> keyboard <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/">has no labels on the keys</a>!</p>

<p> On a normal keyboard, I can type at about 60 wpm, but I only use three or four fingers and I have to periodically glance down at the keyboard.  I hope my new keyboard forces me to learn to touch type properly.  Various coders have written on the subject - Jeff Atwood says <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/11/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second.html">we are typists first</a>; Phil Haack <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/05/dvorak-keyboard-layout-of-champions.aspx">opts for Dvorak</a>.</p>

<p> The <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/"><em>Das Keyboard</em></a> is beautiful.  It's certainly heavier and noisier than other computer keyboards but with such nicely-weighted quality keys that it is a pleasure to type on.  At the moment I am struggling, especially when it comes to brackets () [] {} and punctuation symbols.  Looking down is of no use whatsoever.  Having your hands positioned correctly (with forefingers on the tiny bumps on the <strong>f</strong> and <strong>j</strong> keys) helps a lot, although my ring finger and pinkie are not used to any action whatsoever.</p>

<p> I've been trying <a href="http://play.typeracer.com/">some</a> <a href="http://www.freetypinggame.net/default.asp">typing</a> <a href="http://playwithyourmind.com/online-brain-games/typing-games/typo-ii/">games</a> too.  Suggestions welcome.  My typing speed is currently about 20 wpm with the new keyboard, so I have some catching up to do...</p>
