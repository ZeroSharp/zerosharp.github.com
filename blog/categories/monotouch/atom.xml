    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I took part in <a href="http://buenosaires.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Buenos Aires</a>. It works just like most hackathons:</p>

<p><a href="http://buenosaires.startupweekend.org/2012/11/12/ganadores-swba2012/"><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/blog/basw/BABingo-2puesto-SWBA2012.jpg' width='' height='' alt='New friends: Caro, Eze, Gus and me' title='New friends: Caro, Eze, Gus and me'><span class='caption-text'>New friends: Caro, Eze, Gus and me</span></span></a></p>

<ul>
<li>You give a one minute pitch on Friday evening.</li>
<li>Winners put together a team.</li>
<li>You work with your team on Saturday and Sunday to launch a product.</li>
<li>Demo for the judges.</li>
<li>Prizes. Beer. Sleep.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the Friday I spoke no Spanish and had no idea how to write an iPhone app. By Sunday I still spoke no Spanish, but <strong>I'd built my first app and it won second prize!</strong></p>

<p>How did I learn Objective-C in a weekend? I didn't. I wrote it in C#.</p>

I downloaded <a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">Xamarin MonoTouch</a> onto my <a href="the-best-pc-laptop-is-a-mac">MacBook Pro</a> and was following the 'Hello World' tutorial within an hour. The MonoTouch <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/iOS/Guides">documentation</a> is very clear and the <a href="http://docs2.xamarin.com/ios/samples">samples</a> are very useful. Very soon I had a multiple screen application built, including capturing an image from the camera.</p>

<p>Monotouch makes mobile development really easy for C# programmers. It's also cross-platform so you can re-use big chunks of your code when you write the Android version.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://blog.xamarin.com/eight-reasons-c-sharp-is-the-best-language-for-mobile-development/">this recent blog post from the guys at Xamarin</a>.
