    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>First steps in iPhone development</h2>

<p>This is the first in a series of posts about developing an iOS application from the perspective of a Windows C# developer.</p>

<h3>Startup Weekend</h3>

<p>On a recent month-long trip to South America, I took part in the <a href="http://buenosaires.startupweekend.org/">Buenos Aires Startup Weekend</a> hackathon and my team came second!](/how-i-went-from-c-number-developer-to-iphone-developer-in-a-weekend). The application we built is a treasure hunt game for tourists which helps them discover Buenos Aires. At the beginning of the weekend I knew nothing about mobile development. It was the first time I developed software using a Mac.</p>

<p>First, let's look at the basic requirements for the environment.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/blog/adventures-in-ios-getting-started-001.png" width="450"></p>

<h3>Xamarin MonoTouch</h3>

<p><a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">MonoTouch</a> is the easiest approach for C# developers. It allowed me to write a basic native iPhone app in a weekend with no prior mobile development experience. I'd never used MonoDevelop or XCode either.</p>

<p>MonoTouch is a software development kit for MacOS that cleverly enables you to use C# and the common .NET libraries (via Mono) along with bindings for the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/ios/cocoa-touch.html">Apple Cocoa Touch</a> framework to create native applications for iPhone, iPad and iPod. A lot of the tools are the same as for Objective-C developers: you use the iPhone Simulator and the XCode Interface Builder.</p>

<p>If you are a C# developer still wondering whether to learn Objective-C, there is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1634592/1077279">a magnificent StackOverflow answer</a> comparing MonoTouch and Objective-C.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>There are some costs associated with becoming a MonoTouch iOS developer.</p>

<p>You need a Mac. I'm using a 15" MacBook Pro. I have it configured for dual boot, but I'm using the MacOS side for this project.</p>

<p>You will need to sign up as an iOS developer with Apple. This costs <strong>$99</strong> per year. More information about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/">Apple developer programs on their site</a>.</p>

<p>You will need Xamarin MonoTouch which currently costs <strong>$399</strong> for a one year single seat license for a single developer. More information on pricing at the <a href="https://store.xamarin.com/">Xamarin store</a>.</p>

<h3>Setting up the environment</h3>

<p>Xamarin have an <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/Guides/Getting_Started/Installation">excellent installation guide</a> which guides you through installing both XCode and MonoTouch.</p>

<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>The next step is to create your first iOS application running in the iPhone simulator. Go through the samples in the <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/ios/guides/getting_started">MonoTouch getting started guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Next up</h3>

<p>Over the next few weeks I'm aiming to finish the app I built for Startup Weekend and I'll be sharing what I learn along the way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I took part in <a href="http://buenosaires.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Buenos Aires</a>. It works just like most hackathons:</p>

<p><a href="http://buenosaires.startupweekend.org/2012/11/12/ganadores-swba2012/"><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/blog/basw/BABingo-2puesto-SWBA2012.jpg' width='' height='' alt='New friends: Caro, Eze, Gus and me' title='New friends: Caro, Eze, Gus and me'><span class='caption-text'>New friends: Caro, Eze, Gus and me</span></span></a></p>

<ul>
<li>You give a one minute pitch on Friday evening.</li>
<li>Winners put together a team.</li>
<li>You work with your team on Saturday and Sunday to launch a product.</li>
<li>Demo for the judges.</li>
<li>Prizes. Beer. Sleep.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the Friday I spoke no Spanish and had no idea how to write an iPhone app. By Sunday I still spoke no Spanish, but <strong>I'd built my first app and it won second prize!</strong></p>

<p>How did I learn Objective-C in a weekend? I didn't. I wrote it in C#.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Monotouch makes mobile development really easy for C# programmers.'>
I downloaded <a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">Xamarin MonoTouch</a> onto my <a href="/the-best-pc-laptop-is-a-mac/">MacBook Pro</a> and was following the 'Hello World' tutorial within an hour. The MonoTouch <a href="http://docs.xamarin.com/iOS/Guides">documentation</a> is very clear and the <a href="http://docs2.xamarin.com/ios/samples">samples</a> are very useful. Very soon I had a multiple screen application built, including capturing an image from the camera.</p>

<p>Monotouch makes mobile development really easy for C# programmers. It's also cross-platform so you can re-use big chunks of your code when you write the Android version.</p>
