  <h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>I'm Rob Anderson.  I'm a software developer based in London via Paris and Geneva.  I work from a little office overlooking Regent's Canal with ducks and barges floating past.  My little daughter's favourite word is umbrella.</p>
  <p>I also like Rubik's cubes, robots, artifical intelligence, mathematics, classical guitar, skiing, squash...</p>
