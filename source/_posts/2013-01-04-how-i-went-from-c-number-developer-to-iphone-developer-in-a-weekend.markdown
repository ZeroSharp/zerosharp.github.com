Recently I took part in [Startup Weekend Buenos Aires](http://buenosaires.startupweekend.org/). It works just like most hackathons:

* You give a one minute pitch on Friday evening.
* Winners put together a team.
* You work with your team on Saturday and Sunday to launch a product.
* Demo for the judges.
* Prizes. Beer. Sleep.

On the Friday I spoke no Spanish and had no idea how to write an iPhone app. By Sunday I still spoke no Spanish, but **I'd built my first app and it won second prize!**

How did I learn Objective-C in a weekend? I didn't. I wrote it in C#.

I downloaded [Xamarin MonoTouch](http://xamarin.com/monotouch) onto my [MacBook Pro](/the-best-pc-laptop-is-a-mac/) and was following the 'Hello World' tutorial within an hour. The MonoTouch [documentation](http://docs.xamarin.com/iOS/Guides) is very clear and the [samples](http://docs2.xamarin.com/ios/samples) are very useful. Very soon I had a multiple screen application built, including capturing an image from the camera. 

{"Monotouch makes mobile development really easy for C# programmers."} It's also cross-platform so you can re-use big chunks of your code when you write the Android version.
