Facebook's new Graph Search allows you to easily see anybody's photos.

First, search for someone who is not a friend. Most often, if you navigate to their photos, you see something like this:

{% img /images/blog/facebook-graph-search-001.png %}

You can't see any photos because their privacy settings are not set to 'Public'. It's what you'd expect.

#### Use Graph Search to bypass privacy ####

If you put _Photos of &lt;name&gt;_ or _Photos by &lt;name&gt;_ into the new Facebook graph search __you can view all their photos regardless of their privacy settings__. This works even for friends who have put you on a 'limited' profile.

Your boss/ex/grandma is probably checking out your private photos right now.
