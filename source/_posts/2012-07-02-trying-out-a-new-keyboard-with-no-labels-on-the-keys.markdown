 [{% img right /images/blog/trying-out-a-new-keyboard-001.jpg Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate %}](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/)

 My new ~~keyboarf~~ keyboard [has no labels on the keys](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/)!

 On a normal keyboard, I can type at about 60 wpm, but I only use three or four fingers and I have to periodically glance down at the keyboard.  I hope my new keyboard forces me to learn to touch type properly.  Various coders have written on the subject - Jeff Atwood says [we are typists first](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/11/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second.html); Phil Haack [opts for Dvorak](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/06/05/dvorak-keyboard-layout-of-champions.aspx).

 The [_Das Keyboard_](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/) is beautiful.  It's certainly heavier and noisier than other computer keyboards but with such nicely-weighted quality keys that it is a pleasure to type on.  At the moment I am struggling, especially when it comes to brackets () [] {} and punctuation symbols.  Looking down is of no use whatsoever.  Having your hands positioned correctly (with forefingers on the tiny bumps on the __f__ and __j__ keys) helps a lot, although my ring finger and pinkie are not used to any action whatsoever.  

 I've been trying [some](http://play.typeracer.com/) [typing](http://www.freetypinggame.net/default.asp) [games](http://playwithyourmind.com/online-brain-games/typing-games/typo-ii/) too.  Suggestions welcome.  My typing speed is currently about 20 wpm with the new keyboard, so I have some catching up to do...
