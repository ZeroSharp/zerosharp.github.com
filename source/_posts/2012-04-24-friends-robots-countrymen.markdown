This is the first in a series of posts about robots, past and present.

Since at least the 1950s, people have claimed that we are just around the corner from a robot revolution.  Perhaps it's finally here!  The robots are coming!

Recently there have been substantial advances in many different overlapping domains: the driverless car, unmanned drones, machine vision, machine translation, machine learning, speech recognition, facial recognition, swarm robotics, self-reconfiguring modular robots, powered exoskeletons, nanotechnology, etc.

First up:  here's the **rather terrifying** DARPA AlphaDog Legged Squad Support System (LS3).

The [DARPA website](http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2012/02/07.aspx) says it can **track a specific individual**, so watch your back!
