This is part three of a series of posts about the software and tools I find invaluable. See [Part 1: essential applications](/essential-applications) and [Part 2: Visual Studio tools](/my-essential-visual-studio-tools-and-extensions). In this post I'm covering the online applications and iPhone apps I find indispensible.

## [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/)

Does the job.

## [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com/)

Everyone needs a password manager.

## [Pinboard](https://www.pinboard.in) (and the [PinSwift](https://pinswiftapp.com/) iPhone app)

The best bookmark tracking tool. Simple, fast, powerful. The best mobile app for it is [PinSwift](https://pinswiftapp.com/). 

## [Bear](https://bear.app/)

A very pretty MarkDown editor for Mac and iPhone. I use [Bear](https://bear.app/) for all my notes.

## [Google Drive File Stream](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)

Since I use [GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/), it makes sense to try to put everything there. Google Drive has improved enormously since they moved to a file streaming approach. 

## [Google Tasks](https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas) (and the [GoTasks](gotasksapp.com/) app)

I need simple task manager with support for multiple lists, hierarchies and available everywhere. Google Tasks is often overlooked in this regard. Check out the [Google Tasks canvas](https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas). There is also a fantastic free iPhone app for it [GoTasks](http://gotasksapp.com/).

## [Feedly](https://feedly.com/)

[Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is the best RSS news feed reader, in my opinion. I keep up with a few development blogs, a few science blogs and the blogs of my friends. The mobile app is great too. 

## [Xero](https://www.xero.com/)

I've been using [Xero](https://www.xero.com/) for eight years now. Business accounting software done right.

## [Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp)

I like real books but don't always lug them about with me, so often I buy both the hard copy and the kindle version (there shoudl be some sort of clever discount for this...). The Kindle app is where I spend my time when I have no connectivity (the London tube, airplanes, etc.)

## [Chess.com](https://chess.com) and [Lichess.com](https://lichess.com)

I waste hours playing online blitz chess. I've even written a couple of Chrome extensions: [Pretty print your games](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lichess-print-friendly-pd/goijhimgdjppmhmjkaglhggoapkgobfg) and [Analyse any chess.com game with lichess](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chesscom-v3-analysis/bhjlkimpkkgkmfjlcfngmakenalgleap).

Chess is a mascohistic, character-building pastime. Progress is elusive. You play a couple of good games and you think you're improving and then you get thrashed repeatedly by a 10 year old.
