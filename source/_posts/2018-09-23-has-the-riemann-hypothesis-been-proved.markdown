Tomorrow could be an exciting moment in the history of maths. [Sir Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah) is presenting a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum which will be available on [their youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/LaureateForum). There is a good angle by Ken Regan on the [GÃ¶del's Lost Letter blog](https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/21/the-specter-of-simpler-proofs/).

The Riemann Hypothesis is one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics and the subject of one of my favourite books about maths: [Prime Obsession](https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Obsession-Bernhard-Greatest-Mathematics/dp/0452285259).

A few years ago in Paris, I had the pleasure of seeing [Sir Michael speak](/an-afternoon-with-two-fields-medallists). He spoke so cheerfully about life and mathematics. There is a great interview with him on the [Web of Stories](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVV0r6CmEsFzjttuP9WTFDzu0oAOJBM_3) YouTube channel.
