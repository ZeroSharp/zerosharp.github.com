### Mysterious Shafts in the Great Pyramid of Giza ###

Various robots have been used to explore secret tunnels in the Great Pyramid of Giza.

The tunnels were discovered in 1872 by Waynman Dixon, a British engineer who was helping with a project to undertake accurate measurements of the pyramid.  He noticed a crack in the southern wall of the Queen's Chamber and **discovered a shaft hidden behind the masonry**, as well as a similar shaft in the northern wall.  The shafts are very narrow (20x14cm) and so there was no feasible method of exploring them until recently.  The shafts in question are **shown in red on the diagram above**.  There are two similar shafts in the King's Chamber above it, but these have exits on the outside of the pyramid.

### Enter the Robots ###

In 1992-3, a series of robots were sent into the shafts to explore them.  The most advanced of these was **Upuhaut-2**, built by a German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink.  It was able to **crawl up the southern shaft 63 metres** to reveal a stone slab blocking the shaft.  The slab has two copper clasps and looks like some sort of door.

In 2002, another robot, the **Pyramid Rover** designed by iRobot of Boston (the people behind the Roomba vacuum cleaning robot) in collaboration with the National Geographic Society took the exploration further by drilling a hole through the slab and inserting a miniature fibre-optic camera.  They discovered a space of a few inches followed by ... **another door!**.  The same robot was also able to explore the northern shaft which twists and turns more preventing earlier robots from getting very far.  It too ends up with a door approximately 63 metres from the entrance.

The **[Djedi Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djedi_Project)** is a team of International and Egyptian experts currently dedicated to the further robot exploration of the tunnels via robots.  In 2011, it managed to drill a similar hole in the door at the end of the northern shaft.  The robot was also equipped with a miniature snake camera which was able to view the small chamber beyond the door and, in particular, **some reddish hieroglyphs**.  Here's a video from one of the sponsors of the project.
